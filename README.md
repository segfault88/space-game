# space-game

I am bad at naming things, this will do for now. Why are you looking at this? For the moment this is just me messing around with some OpenGL / Graphics stuff...

## Building

Switched to GYP from CMake since I find it a real pain to work with. But maybe it's just me...

I am only working on OSX atm.

```
# install gyp
gyp --depth=.

# open the project / build / run
```

## Using

SDL2, GLEW, GLM, FreeImage.

## Screenshot

This is what it currently looks like:
